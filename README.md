# SUST-CSE-14-Web-System
This is a web application from where the students of my batch can share their discussion like facebook. They can make posts here, comment on a post, like or dislike a post. Besides these the people can get notified about their upcoming exam as well as Semester Day Count, Class Schedule of the following day.  The following image shows these features. ![alt text](ScreenShots/01.JPG?raw=true "Title") 
All the activities are notified to all the students using notification system. The following image shows the notification system. ![alt text](ScreenShots/02.JPG?raw=true "Title") Through notification one can easily get into that respective post just like facebook. Here they can manage their comments also. ![alt text](ScreenShots/03.JPG?raw=true "Title"). The people can also update their class schedule. Once updated all the registered member will be notified using Push Notification as well as regular notification. ![alt text](ScreenShots/04.JPG?raw=true "Title"). Student can also update their upcoming examination schedule and can see it right aside the posts instead of Facebook Add :P ![alt text](ScreenShots/05.JPG?raw=true "Title"). Every update is notified like the following screen ![alt text](ScreenShots/06.JPG?raw=true "Title"). And now look there is a new upcoming examination schedule is avalable on the right aside ![alt text](ScreenShots/07.JPG?raw=true "Title"). Oh...By the way the people can also manage their account in their personal DashBoard. Here they can update their BIO and Password indeed. ![alt text](ScreenShots/08.JPG?raw=true "Title"). Possibly everything is Done but there is one more. They can share their class notes among themselves. ![alt text](ScreenShots/09.JPG?raw=true "Title"). Once shared they can easily navigate through all their available notes Just Like a Library at home.![alt text](ScreenShots/10.JPG?raw=true "Title"). And look they are nicely organized in course separated manner. Just click and download is needed. ![alt text](ScreenShots/11.JPG?raw=true "Title") Sometimes notes might not be available :( Don't worry anyone can share it :P ![alt text](ScreenShots/12.JPG?raw=true "Title")

The main motivation behind this Project is to reduce the use of Facebook in educational purposes. FaceBook are really time killing for students. This system is focuced on providing only the very basic features of Facebook for discussion and tons of features for educational help and knowledge sharing. Thanks
